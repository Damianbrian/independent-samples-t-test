# independent-samples-t-test
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the application of an **independent-samples t-test** to evaluate whether two groups differ significantly in their post-test scores.

---

## Objective
The goal of this analysis is to test the hypothesis that **Group A** and **Group B** have different mean post-test scores, based on data generated or collected during a mentorship study.

---

## Notebook Overview
The notebook covers:
1. **Data Generation / Loading** – Creating a simulated dataset for the analysis.  
2. **Descriptive Statistics** – Summarizing the mean, standard deviation, and group counts.  
3. **Visual Exploration** – Inspecting score distributions between groups.  
4. **Assumption Testing**  
   - Normality (Shapiro–Wilk Test)  
   - Equality of Variances (Levene’s Test)  
5. **Independent Samples t-Test** – Performing and interpreting results.  
6. **Conclusion** – Reporting statistical findings with p-values and decision rules.
